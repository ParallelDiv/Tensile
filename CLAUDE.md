# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tensile is an offline-first, minimalist workout tracker app built with Flutter for Android.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository. The codebase structure has not yet been established. Once Flutter project files are added, this document should be updated with:

- Build and test commands
- Project architecture and key patterns
- State management approach
- Data persistence strategy (for offline-first functionality)
- Android-specific considerations
